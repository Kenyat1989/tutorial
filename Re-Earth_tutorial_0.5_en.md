# Re:Earth Tutorial "Le Corbusier's Archive
## Overview
![Le Corbusier](Le_Corbusier_(1964).jpg)
Le Corbusier (1887-1965) was a Swiss architect who worked mainly in France as a master of modernist architecture. His works are registered as a World Heritage Site as "Le Corbusier's Architectural Works - Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Architectural Movement".  
In this tutorial, we will create a digital archive of this body of work and his career.

### 2.3 Making markers into image icons
Set the marker to an image of Le Corbusier.  
![](2_004.gif)

Image URL: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Le_Corbusier_%281964%29.jpg/480px-Le_Corbusier_%281964%29.jpg]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Le_Corbusier_%281964%29.jpg/480px-Le_Corbusier_%281964%29.jpg)

`Display method: Icon`, the following items will be displayed.
  

- Image URL: Allows you to upload an image.
- Image Size: Allows you to set the size of the image.
- Crop: You can choose to display the image as it is or crop it into a circle.
- Shadow: Allows you to add a shadow to the image icon; if turned on, the shadow setting will appear.
- Shadow Color: Allows you to set the color of the shadow.
- Shadow radius: Set the size of the shadow.
- Shadow X: Allows you to set the vertical position of the shadow.
- Shadow Y: Allows you to set the horizontal position of the shadow.
  
  

### 2.4 Moving the marker position
Let's move the marker to the location of the National Museum of Western Art by setting the `position`.  
![](2_005.gif)

Latitude and longitude of the National Museum of Western Art  
>latitude: 35.715415
>Longitude: 139.775844

If you want to find out the latitude and longitude from an address or a place name, you can use Geographical Survey Institute maps if you are in Japan, or Google Maps if you are outside Japan.

### 2.5 Setting marker names
In Re:Earth, the data created by markers, photo overlays, and sphere tools are collectively called "layers".
The left panel is divided into two parts: the part to manage these layers and the part to manage scenes and widgets.

Let's change the display name from `marker' to `National Museum of Western Art' for clarity.

![](2_007.gif)

> Marker → National Museum of Western Art

### 2.6 Adding a label
Let's add a label to the marker of the National Museum of Western Art, which has just been renamed. 
The marker name set in the left panel is the name when editing, but the label is the name that will be displayed when the archive is published.

When `Label` is turned on, the setting item of the label will be displayed.  
Enter "National Museum of Western Art" in the displayed `label text` field.

![](2_007.gif)
  

- Label: Allows you to give a label to the marker; when turned on, the label setting item will be displayed.
- Label text: Allows you to set the label name.
- You can set the font, line alignment, bold, italic, and underline.  

## Create an infobox for markers
### 3.1. 
Switch the tab at the top of the right panel from the current `layer` to the middle `infobox`.  
![](3_001.gif)

### 3.2 Create a new infobox
Click the `New Infobox` button to add an infobox to the selected marker.  
![](3_002.gif)

### 3.3 Setting the contents of the infobox
From the `+` button of the displayed infobox, you can select the contents to be embedded in the infobox.  
![](3_003.gif)

Select the appropriate content format from the following five types.  

- Text: Text
- Image: Image
- Video: Video
- Location: Map
- Table: Table
  
This time, let's choose `Image` -> `Text` -> `Text` in this order.  

### 3.4 Setting up image content
Click on the image icon in the infobox to open a window for uploading images, etc.  
 ## (Please add or replace here since the upload function is now available! ＞I'm not sure what to do.
Paste the URL of the image you want to display in the `image` field.  
Corbusier's image URL: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/National_museum_of_western_art05s3200.jpg](https://upload. wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/National_museum_of_western_art05s3200.jpg)  

![](3_004.gif)

- Full Size: Enlarge the image to its maximum width.
- Image Size: Sets the size of the image. With `cover` the image will be cropped to fit the image frame. In `Include`, the image will be scaled to fit the frame without changing its proportions.
- Horizontal Position: Sets the horizontal alignment of the image. You can choose between left-justified, center-justified, and right-justified.  
- Vertical Position: Allows you to set the vertical position of the image. You can select Top, Center, or Bottom alignment.  

### 3.5 Text Content Settings

- Summary    
````
The National Museum of Western Art (1955) is the only remaining art museum in Taito-ku, Tokyo, for which Le Corbusier was responsible for the basic design.
The National Museum of Western Art (1955), located in Taito-ku, Tokyo, was designed by Le Corbusier. It is not only the only Le Corbusier building left in Japan, but also the only one in East Asia.  
The National Museum of Western Art (NMWA) was realized when the Matsukata Collection was donated and returned from France, and it was necessary to build a museum to receive it.
The details of the appointment of Le Corbusier are unknown, but it is said that the "Preparatory Council for the Establishment of the Tentative Name of the French Museum of Fine Arts," which was established in Japan in December 1953, suggested that a famous French architect should be appointed to impress the French side, and that they wanted to take this opportunity to realize the works of a world-famous architect in Japan. I was told that Le Corbusier was contracted to do the project.  
Le Corbusier was only contracted to do the basic design of the museum, while three Japanese architects, Junzo Sakakura, Kunio Maekawa, and Takamasa Yoshizaka, were in charge of the implementation design, including the specific dimensions. Le Corbusier based his basic design on a visit to Japan in November 1955, the only one in his life.
